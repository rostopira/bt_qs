# BT QS

Google changed Bluetooth QS tile in Android 14.
I've been asked to make same simple tile as my previous [WiFi QS](https://github.com/rostopira/wifi_qs) project.

Target API 30 is required to allow this app to turn Bluetooth on and off without extra permission.
I can't publish this in Google Play, since it requires minimum target API 33.
